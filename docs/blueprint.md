# **App Name**: Build Vs Break

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using student emails, managed with Firebase Auth. Enforce email validation and password strength using standard practices.
- Dynamic Content Loading: Fetch event details (such as rules, leaderboard, and team assignments) from Firebase, updating in real-time to reflect the current status of the Build & Break event. (Future Enhancement)
- Animated UI Transitions: Implement engaging page transitions using CSS and React, with shuffling card animations when the page changes to maintain user interest. Also animate elements to catch attention.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9F00FF) to capture the energetic, innovative spirit of the AI/ML club.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#1A1A2E) to enhance the contrast with the UI elements.
- Accent color: Contrasting light purple (#D4A3FF) to highlight interactive components.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel. Good for headlines or short sections of body text. For longer text blocks, use 'Inter' (sans-serif).
- Use geometric and minimalist icons that are suitable for the content, that relate to the technology field. Incorporate small animated elements.
- Employ a modular layout, utilizing grid and flexbox to ensure a fully responsive design across various screen sizes, and proper spacing throughout the app. Make the main card swipe or flip while changing between register and login forms.
- Animate form components upon focus or hover to guide user interaction; implement subtle transitions when loading new content to enhance the sense of fluidity. Animate sections of text when they appear to focus user attention on important info.
